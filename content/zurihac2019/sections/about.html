  <p>
    Middle of June 2019, the
    <a href="https://zfoh.ch/">Z端rich Friends of Haskell association</a>
    will organize ZuriHac 2019, a three day
    <a href="https://haskell.org/">Haskell</a>
    Hackathon hosted at the
    <a href="https://www.hsr.ch/en/">HSR Hochschule f端r Technik Rapperswil</a>.
    This is the eighth Haskell Hackathon organized in Z端rich and and the third
    one hosted at the HSR. This fantastic venue is located right at lake Z端rich
    and provides space for more than 400 participants.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Haskell Hackathon is a <strong>completely free</strong>, international,
    grassroots collaborative coding festival whose goal is to expand the
    community and to build and improve Haskell libraries, tools, and
    infrastructure.  This is a great opportunity to learn more about Haskell,
    meet fellow Haskellers in real life, find new contributors for your project,
    improve existing libraries and tools or even start new ones!
  </p>
  <p>
    This event is open to any experience level, from beginners to gurus. In
    fact, one of the goals is to bring beginners in contact with experts so that
    the former can get a quick start in the Haskell community.
    We will have a dedicated beginners' course, and there will be mentors on
    site whom you can directly approach during the whole event with any
    Haskell-related question you have.
