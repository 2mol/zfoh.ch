Tests are though still needed! In particular for code which depends on conditions not captured by the type system. An example of such code is (first-order) unification [1], a classic algorithm used for example in type checkers, Prolog interpreters, and theorem provers.</p> <p>In this interactive live-coding talk, we'll together<br/>- revisit the theory of first-order terms, substitutions, and unification;<br/>- explore how to use hedgehog [2] to implement unification in a test-driven fashion; and<br/>- learn how to use ghcid [3] to get live test feedback.</p> <p>PS: In case you wonder: why unification? Blinded by the ease of writing (mostly) correct Haskell code, past-me was not very big into testing. During my PhD, I've learned the hard way that unification is one of the algorithms that has ample room for subtle mistakes -- and tests are absolutely a must! Back then, I've written a number of regression tests to capture the problems after the fact. This talk is the result of present-me exploring how TDD combined with modern property-based testing fares in detecting these subtle mistakes up-front.</p> <p>[1] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)#First-order_term" class="linkified">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)#First-order_term</a><br/>[2] <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog" class="linkified">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog</a><br/>[3] <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghcid" class="linkified">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghcid</a></p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/253928652/">Bring Your Own Coding Problem #3</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/251632689/">Alex Silva - A Tour of Dependent Types with Idris</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/250661375/">GHC Newcomers Guide</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/249734259/">Bring Your Own Coding Problem #2</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/248510184/">Nicolas Mattia - Interactive data exploration using Jupyter, Haskell and Nix</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/247340310/">Getting things done in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/246552004/">BYOCP Nr. 1 - Bring Your Own Coding Problem</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/245248358/">Tom Sydney Kerckhove - An overview of validity based testing</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/242872978/">Edward Kmett - Introductory Talk on a Surprise Topic</a></li></ul></div></div>
