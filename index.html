      <h1>Zürich Friends of Haskell</h1>
      <p>
        The Zürich Friends of Haskell is a club founded to foster the
        worldwide knowledge of functional programming, and Haskell in
        particular.  We organise
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/" target="_blank">meetups</a>
        and
        <a href="http://zurihac.info/" target="_blank">events</a>
        in the Zürich area.

    <p>
      The HaskellerZ meetup group has been around since 2011.  After organising
      many meetups and events, in particular ZuriHac, which attracts people from
      all over the world, there was a need to formalise our group a bit more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the short term, this allows us to work together better with sponsors
      for ZuriHac.  In the long term, however, we would like to guarantee the
      long-time success of a Zurich-based Haskell interest group, not dependent
      on one or two key volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules are set up so that we encourage non-monetary contributions (e.g.
      giving a talk).  Of course, membership is optional and not required to
      attend any of our events.

    <h3>Become a member!</h3>
    <p>
      For members, we ask a yearly contribution of either:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>giving at least one talk at the Zurich HaskellerZ meetup,</li>
      <li>helping organize ZuriHac in an official role,</li>
      <li>serving on the board of directors for the Zurich Friends of Haskell</li>
      <li>providing other voluntary work asked for by the board of directors, or</li>
      <li>paying a membership fee of 50 CHF.</li>
    </ol>

He presents a reproducible setup with Nix to use Haskell from a Jupyter notebook, will show how to easily read data from the GitHub and GeoNames APIs, how to "crunch" that with data the `vector` library and finally how to display it with the `diagrams` library -- all of this in an interactive, live-coding fashion using an in-browser notebook.</p> <p>This talk is accessible to HaskellerZ of all levels. We expect beginners to learn how to query APIs using the `wreq` library and how to do some basic array manipulations with the `vector` library and intermediate Haskellers to learn how to use `lens-aeson` to consume JSON APIs in a way very similar to `jq`. The HaskellerZ unfamiliar with Jupyter and Nix will discover how those tools can be used to craft reproducible, visually interesting notebooks that can be shared and tweaked.</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/247340310/">Getting things done in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/246552004/">BYOCP Nr. 1 - Bring Your Own Coding Problem</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/245248358/">Tom Sydney Kerckhove - An overview of validity based testing</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/242872978/">Edward Kmett - Introductory Talk on a Surprise Topic</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/241206795/">Attend the BUSCONF 2017</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/241206981/">Tom Sydney Kerckhove - Signature Inference for Property Discovery with EasySpec</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/238062185/">ZuriHac 2017</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/240008424/">Michal Terepeta - New approaches to serialization in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/239040181/">Andreas Lochbihler - Functional Programming and Proving in Isabelle/HOL</a></li></ul></div></div>

<p>
  We try to record all of our meetups and keynotes so Friends of Haskell who are
  not in the Zürich area can enjoy the content as well.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiU7KJ5_df6YRVS8CMoedeFHamRgiJkwQ">This playlist</a>
  contains all our Haskell-related videos.
</p>
<p>
  We have also collected the slides of the presentations in
  <a href="https://github.com/meiersi/HaskellerZ/">this repository</a>.
  Unfortunately, the collection is currently incomplete.
